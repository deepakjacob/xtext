Version 2.9 adds support for IntelliJ and includes many bug fixes. ([full bugzilla list](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&list_id=11217573&query_format=advanced&status_whiteboard=v2.9&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr)).


## IntelliJ IDEA support

There is now an Xtend plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA. The plug-in provides a smart code editor for Xtend files, including syntax highlighting, code completion, on-the-fly validation, automatic compilation in the background, and more. The plug-in uses the same parser and compiler as Eclipse, but we had to re-implement large parts of the UI integration code.

Create a new Xtend type (class, interface, or enum) inside Java packages.

Enjoy the smart code editor with syntax highlighting and code completion. The latter also proposes Xtend's extension methods. The example from this screenshot is a small JUnit test, which - obviously - can also be launched as such.  


## Android Studio Support

Xtend now supports [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/studio.html), which uses IntelliJ IDEA as a foundation. This is not to be confused with the [Android Developer Tools](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adt.html), which are based on Eclipse and which have been supported by Xtend since the very beginning. 

This is exciting news as it allows you to use lambda expressions and Active Annotations for Android development - something neither Android Studio nor ADT support out of the box.
