Today we've released a preview version for the upcoming IntelliJ IDEA support of Xtext. 
With this it is now possible to _develop Xtext languages entirely in IDEA_ and due to the cool Gradle support in any other environment, too.

The preview plugins for IntelliJ IDEA can be installed from the following repository location:

[http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/idea/2.9.0.beta5/updatePlugins.xml](http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/idea/2.9.0.beta5/updatePlugins.xml)

You need to install all three plugins from this repository into the latest [IDEA 15 Preview](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/).

There is a [screencast on vimeo](https://player.vimeo.com/video/141201249) that shows what Xtext in IntellijJ IDEA looks like.

Please try it out and provide feedback through bugzilla or elsewhere.
